#Project 3 - Online Registration Form

Main Objective: Build a responsive registration form that is friendly across all screen sizes ranging from desktop computers to smart phones. Make sure you follow the "mobile-first" approach during development. No backend is required, just design and develop the front end section of the site.

Note: These projects are intended to train you in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and let you practice and show your mastery of these fundamental building blocks of the web. Because of that, please avoid using frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, Skeleton and so on for this project. Even though you may end up using frameworks like these professionally, you still need to know and be able to implement the designs with your own knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
