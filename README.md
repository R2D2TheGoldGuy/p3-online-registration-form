# Project 3 - Online Registration Form

Instructions:
- Code a registration form without using CSS Frameworks (e.g. Bootstrap, Foundations)
- Must be responsive
- Use the mockups as a guide or reference to your design (doesn't have to look 100% like the mockup)
- No server-side code as this is a project for front-end development
